# CoreMLDemo
A very simple CoreML demo based on some tutorials.

This project uses Inceptionv3 MLModel. It's not included yet to this repository, download the MLModel manually here:
https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/coreml/models/Inceptionv3.mlmodel

Then you should be able to run the project.
